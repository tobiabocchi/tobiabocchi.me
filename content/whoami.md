## Sport

![rugby](/img/about/rugby.jpeg)

I started track & field in 2006, at the age of 9, while also playing rugby in my
[hometown's team](https://rugbyparma.it/). Growing up, I reached a point where playing
two sports at a high level was too physically demanding, not to mention the fact
that in the meantime I was attending the local 'scientific' high school. Leaving
rugby broke my heart, but my decision regarding track was very certain.

A few of the best memories I carry with me from my youth career are the first
**U16 national title** in 2012 and the **silver medal** at the **Youth Olympic Games**
in Nanjing, China in 2014. Now I am on the Italian national team, and in the last
few years, I have collected a few other good memories: my first **national title**
(2021) where I also scored the standard for the **Tokyo Olympic Games**, where I
competed and ranked 13th in August, and the **silver medal** at the
**Mediterranean Games** in Oran (2022). I am currently training with one goal:
Paris 2024.

## Point of Contact

![UCLA](/img/about/UCLA.jpeg)

Track & field takes up a big chunk of my life. But the main purpose of this website,
other than telling you a little about me, is to share my notes, knowledge, and activities
in the field of computer science. And it's probably thanks to my sport that I fell
in love so much with the subject. In 2016, I was offered the opportunity to fly
to Los Angeles to attend [UCLA](https://www.ucla.edu) with an athletic scholarship,
an opportunity that 18-year-old me could not miss out on. On the athletic side,
this turned out not to be the best choice for me, but on the academic side, I learned
the basics of a subject in one of the world's best universities in a very competitive
and stimulating environment. This lit a spark inside my head.

## Computer Science

During my sophomore year at UCLA, I faced some very critical health issues that
put my life and athletic career at risk. I was forced to come back home and recover.
I finished my undergraduate degree at the [local university](https://www.unipr.it/)
where I was frustrated most of the time because it was not the same competitive,
dynamic, and cutting-edge environment that I loved at UCLA. My graduation grade
was **108/110** and my final thesis' title was
_"Wait Time Prediction For The Italian Healthcare System Using Machine Learning Algorithms"_.
For the final project, I implemented a model to predict the waiting times of people
at healthcare structures (mainly hospitals).
After finishing my undergraduate degree, I decided to continue my studies in the
University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, [UniMoRe](https://www.unimore.it/)
Where I graduated from my master with **110 Cum Laude**. My final thesis was titled
_"Securing The Lens: Designing a General Framework for performing Security Assessments
on Internet Connected Cameras"_.
